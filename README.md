# VeriSum-CPU
Designed and implemented a custom 34-bit multi-cycle CPU using SystemVerilog, capable of executing a custom instruction set architecture (ISA). The project involved building key components such as a register file, ALU, instruction and data memory, and a finite state machine (FSM) for control flow.
